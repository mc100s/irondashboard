## Setup

Let's say you have a squad that starts on **2019-08-05** with the Trello board **https://trello.com/b/iW3IjFQW/cohort-152**.

Then you need to create a `.env` file like this:
```
REACT_APP_TRELLO_BOARD_ID=iW3IjFQW
REACT_APP_FIRST_DAY=2019-08-05
```



## Commands

To install all the packages:
```
npm install
```


To run the project in development mode (accessible on http://localhost:3000):
```
npm start
```


To build the project in a `build` folder:
```
npm run build
```
